# Mupen64Plus 256MB build system
I created this script to compile Mupen64Plus across various platforms in one go, notably adding compatibility for B3313 and other large romhacks.

## Improvements are welcome!
Features:
- Android build needs to be dockerized
- Nintendo Switch build needs to be added (I just gave up on a pointer mismatch in the upstream code for now, as I remember it taking ages to get it built)
- If possible, feel free to add other systems (Mac OS, iOS, etc) or Mupen variants as well

Fixes:
- Performance improvements (for the build process, or for the built binaries)
- Anything that's broken (incompatibilities, etc)
